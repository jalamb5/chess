_Note to self_
There are still several to-dos and bugs with this project as of Aug-29-22.
Most basic functionality has been implemented but game over isn't complete and there are new bugs in movement (king/queen) filed in issues. I believe this to likely have been caused by recent work in piece_movement and the newly created king_movement module.
Choosing to move on to another project for the time being so, noting this for future me when I return.
